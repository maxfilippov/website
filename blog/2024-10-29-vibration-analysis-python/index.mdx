To see the article localy, run `yarn install` and `yarn start` in the root directory of the project.

Links should be in bold, e.g. [**Replication Guide**](/docs/guides/data-replication).

The intro should be before the truncate below.

Images can be added like:
![Alt text](./img/social-card.jpg)

{/* truncate */}

The rest of the article should be after the truncate.

Thanks for reading, I hope this article will help you choose the right storage strategy for your vibration data.
